## Engineering style

Prefer boring, flat, readable code.

- Apply YAGNI aggressively. Do not introduce factories, generic wrappers,
  plugin systems, configuration frameworks, extension points, or generalized
  abstractions for hypothetical future requirements.
- Implement the minimum functionality required by the current specification.
- Prefer a small concrete implementation over a generalized framework.
- Prefer duplication over a premature or incorrect abstraction. Extract an
  abstraction when repeated code represents the same stable concept, not merely
  because two blocks look similar.
- Prefer standard-library functionality when it is simple and sufficient.
  Add dependencies when they materially simplify or improve the solution.
- Keep control flow shallow. Prefer early returns and straightforward sequential
  logic over deeply nested branches.
- Keep functions cohesive and reasonably small, but do not split code merely to
  satisfy a line-count rule.
- Use clear names instead of comments that restate the code. Comments should
  explain non-obvious constraints, invariants, tradeoffs, or reasons.
- Do not create architecture for requirements that are explicitly deferred.
- Preserve existing architecture boundaries unless the task requires changing them.
- Before introducing a new abstraction, layer, dependency, or subsystem, consider
  whether a simpler concrete solution solves the current problem more robustly.

## Testing guidance

Prefer a small number of high-value tests for realistic regression risks at stable boundaries.

Do test:
- durable state transitions and recovery
- protocol parsing/validation
- deduplication and retry behavior
- persistence/crash consistency
- authority and permission boundaries
- artifact identity/integrity
- externally observable workflow behavior

Do not add tests merely to increase coverage.

Avoid tests that:
- mirror implementation details
- assert constructor signatures or trivial getters/setters
- test every enum value or branch independently
- pin exact log text, UI wording, formatting, or internal call order
- mock large parts of the system only to verify plumbing
- duplicate guarantees already provided by type checking, compilation, or framework behavior

Prefer integration tests when the important property crosses process, persistence, protocol, or filesystem boundaries.

Use compilation/type checking/linting/manual validation where those provide better confidence than unit tests.

Before adding a test, ask:
1. What realistic regression would this catch?
2. Is this boundary stable?
3. Would this test still be useful after an internal refactor?

If those answers are weak, do not add the test.

Do not create tests for behavior that is already better validated by an end-to-end slice acceptance test.

## Scope discipline

Implement the requested slice, not the imagined future product.

When several solutions satisfy the requirements, prefer the one with:
1. fewer concepts,
2. fewer moving parts,
3. fewer dependencies,
4. less hidden behavior,
5. easier failure recovery.

Do not generalize from one implementation unless the current requirements
already contain multiple real cases that require the generalization.
